/**
 * A dialog represents a peer-to-peer SIP relationship between two user agents
 * that persists for some time. Dialogs are typically used by user agents to
 * facilitate management of state. Dialogs are typically not relevant to proxy
 * servers. The dialog facilitates sequencing of messages between the user
 * agents and proper routing of requests between both of them. The dialog
 * represents a context in which to interpret SIP Transactions and Messages.
 * However, a Dialog is not necessary for message processing.
 * <p>
 * A dialog is identified at each User Agent with a dialog Id, which consists of
 * a Call-Id value, a local tag and a remote tag. The dialog Id at each User
 * Agent involved in the dialog is not the same. Specifically, the local tag at
 * one User Agent is identical to the remote tag at the peer User Agent. The
 * tags are opaque tokens that facilitate the generation of unique dialog Ids.
 * <p>
 * A dialog contains certain pieces of data needed for further message
 * transmissions within the dialog. This data consists of:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Dialog Id - used to identify the dialog.
 * <li> Local sequence number - used to order requests from the User Agent to
 * its peer.
 * <li> Remote sequence number - used to order requests from its peer to the
 * User Agent.
 * <li> Local URI - the address of the local party.
 * <li> Remote URI - the address of the remote party.
 * <li> Remote target - the address from the Contact header field of the request
 * or response or refresh request or response.
 * <li> "secure" boolean - determines if the dialog is secure i.e. use the
 * <var>sips:</var> scheme.
 * <li> Route set - an ordered list of URIs. The route set is the list of
 * servers that need to be traversed to send a request to the peer.
 * </ul>
 * A dialog also has its own state machine, the current {@link DialogState} is
 * determined by the sequence of messages that occur on the initial dialog.
 * <p>
 * <b>Invite Dialog States:</b><br>
 * Null --> Early --> Confirmed --> Terminated
 * <p>
 * <b>Other Dialog-creating Requests
 * Dialog States (ie. SUBSCRIBE):</b><br>
 * Null --> Confirmed --> Terminated.
 * <p>
 * The Listener MUST ACK the 2xx response associated with an INVITE dialog.
 * Retransmissions of the ACK in response to subsequent INVITE requests are
 * handled by the dialog layer. If a listener does not ACK a 2XX response
 * immediately, the implementation will terminate the Dialog automatically and
 * remove it from the stack when the listener completes its execution.
 * <p>
 * The dialog layer MUST respond with an automatic error response when <a href =
 * "http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt">RFC3261</a> specifies that the User
 * Agent MUST respond with a certain error. This does not apply for successful
 * responses like 200 OK. The error condition relates directly to the dialog
 * layer and the SipListener can add no meaningful information to the response.
 * Such a response can be constructed and sent entirely by the dialog layer on
 * behalf of the SipListener. Under such circumstances, it makes sense to let
 * the dialog support handle the response and not bother the SipListener with
 * it. The SipListener will not be notified with the RequestEvent upon which the
 * Response was sent on its behalf by the Dialog layer. However, if no Dialog is
 * registered for the transaction either automatically or under application
 * control, then the SipListener is expected to generate and send the
 * appropriate (error) response.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>For example:</b> In <a href =
 * "http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt">RFC3261</a> Chapter 14 a User Agent
 * Server that receives a second INVITE before it sends the final response to a
 * first INVITE with a lower CSeq sequence number on the same dialog MUST return
 * a 500 (Server Internal Error) response to the second INVITE and MUST include
 * a Retry-After header field with a randomly chosen value of between 0 and 10
 * seconds.
 *
 * In this release of this specification, the implementation handles retransmissions of
 * Responses that are specified as being handled by the UA core, if there is an
 * associated Dialog for a given transaction.
 * If there is no associated Dialog for a given transaction, the application
 * will be alerted to perform the retransmissions required by the UA core if
 * desired. Applications should explicitly request such alerts see
 * {@link ServerTransaction#enableRetransmissionAlerts()}. Once enabled the
 * SipProvider will deliver retransmission timer
 * events to the Listener with a {@link Timeout#RETRANSMIT} notification. The
 * SipListener can then retransmit the Response as necessary, see
 * {@link SipListener#processTimeout(TimeoutEvent)}.
 * <p>
 * For INVITE Client Transactions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>UAC ACKs first 2xx response </li>
 * <li>Additional 2xx responses  will be ACKed automatically if a Dialog is
 *  asssociated with the response</li>
 * <li>Additional 2xx responses will be presented to the listener if no dialog
 * is associated with the response. In such a case the listener is expected to
 * ACK the 2xx response.
 * </ul>
 *
 * For INVITE Server Transaction 2xx response:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Application sends first 2xx response {@link ServerTransaction#sendResponse(Response)}.
 * <li> If a Dialog is not associated with a ServerTransaction, and if the
 * application explicitly requests to be notified of such timeouts (see
 * {@link ServerTransaction#enableRetransmissionAlerts()} the SipListener is
 * periodically alerted to retransmit 2xx responses for the ServerTransaction.</li>
 * <li> If a Dialog is associated with a ServerTransaction then the
 * implementation takes care of retransmitting final responses until the ACK is
 * received i.e. the SipListener will receive no notifications to retransmit
 * responses.
 * </ul>
 *
 * For an INVITE server Transaction 300-699 response:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Either the application or the dialog layer sends the first response
 * <li> Retransmissions of 300-699 responses from the INVITE Server Transaction
 * are handled by the transaction layer independent of existence of an
 * associated Dialog.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Because reliable provisional responses are always sent by the Dialog layer,
 * the Dialog layer takes care of retrasmitting these. The application is never
 * alerted for retransmissions of Reliable Provisional responses:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The application sends a reliable provisional Response to an Invite
 * Dialog using {@link javax.sip.Dialog#sendReliableProvisionalResponse(Response) }
 * <li> The Stack takes care of retransmitting the provisional response with
 * exponentially increasing intervals until a PRACK is received or the
 * Transaction times out.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Processing Forking INVITES:
 * <p>
 * Multiple 2xx responses may arrive at the UAC for a single INVITE request due
 * to a forking proxy. Each response is distinguished by the tag parameter in
 * the TO header field, and each represents a distinct Dialog, with a distinct
 * Dialog identifier. In this case the first 2xx terminates the original INVITE
 * additional 2xx responses will be presented to the SipListener as a ResponseEvent
 * with null Client Transaction ID but with a valid and distinct Dialog. The
 * Listener is expected to ACK the 2xx response - otherwise the Dialog is
 * terminated after a timeout period. Note that unless automatic dialog creation
 * is explictly disabled, the 2xx ResponseEvent will always contain a Dialog whether
 * or not the outgoing INVITE was sent through a ClientTransaction or statelessly
 * via a SipProvider.
