  This package contains the interfaces representing SIP messages. There are 
two type of messages, namely Request and Response: 		                   <br>
 
<ul>
   <li><a href="Request.html">Request</a> - these messages are sent from
the client to server. They contain a specific method type that identifies
the type of Request, a Request-URI which indicates the user or service to
which this request is being addressed, along with various Headers and Body
that make up the content of the Request.</li>
   <li><a href="Response.html">Response</a> - these messages sent from server 
to client in response to a Request.&nbsp;They contain a specific status code 
that identifies the type of Response, a Request-URI which indicates the user 
or service to which this request is being addressed, a reason phrase that 
is intended for the human user, along with various Headers and Body that make
up the content of the Response.</li>
 
</ul>
   Messages may contain multiple Headers and multiple Headers of the same
type. The order of all Headers within a message is significant, i.e. Headers
which are hop-by-hop  must appear before any Headers which are end-to-end.
A message Body contains a session description  	. This format is represented
as an Object in this specification, which	allows the body to be a String
or an Object type defined the Session Description Protocol (SDP) specification.<br>
<p>
   Additionally this package contains a MessageFactory class that defines 
methods for creating new requests and responses. The MessageFactory is a 
singleton object, which can be obtained from the {@link javax.sip.SipFactory}.
