The sub-packages of this package contain examples for features that are
specific to the NIST implementation of JSIP (i.e. may not be available on
other JSIP implementations).  If you find some of these features useful,
ask on the JAIN-SIP-INTEREST list and it is possible that there will
be enough general interest in the feature that it may be considered for
inclusion in a future release.

For a full list of NIST-SIP only features supported by the implementation,
please take a look at the javadoc for

gov.nist.javax.sip.SipStackImpl

You will see a number of additional properties for enabling specific
features. If you have a specific feature to suggest, mail the users
list.

Caution : Use of these features may result in your application becoming
unportable across different vendor implementations of the JSIP standard.
