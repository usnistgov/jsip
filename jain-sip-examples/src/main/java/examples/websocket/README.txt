This is a Websocket B2BUA server

To run this example, open up two windows.  

From the first one, type

 "ant b2bua" 

Now the server is ready and running. You can register two websocket phones into it
and make a call between them.

For illustrative purposes, this example turns debugging and logging on. You
should do so when you are developing your applications.
