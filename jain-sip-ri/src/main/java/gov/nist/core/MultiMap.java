/** 
 * This is simply a Map with slightly different semantics.
 * Instead of returning an Object, it returns a Collection.
 * So for example, you can put( key, new Integer(1) ); 
 * and then a Object get( key ); will return you a Collection 
 * instead of an Integer.
 * Thus, this is simply a tag interface.
