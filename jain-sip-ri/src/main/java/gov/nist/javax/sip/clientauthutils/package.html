<body>
This package contains a set of utilities for client side Authentication Challenge handling. It has been
adapted from the SIP communicator project and generously dontated to the JAIN-SIP project 
It is not part of the standard JAIN-SIP implementation at this point but is being considered for
addition as this is an operation that is commonly required by all SIP clients; it is hence a good capability
to include in a library such as JAIN-SIP.  

<p/> Primary authors of this code are Emil Ivov with corrections from Jeroen van Bemmel.
