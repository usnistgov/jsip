This is a set of torture test cases that will be expanded over time. The input 
to these test cases is an xml file called torture.xml. 

The input file (torture.xml) consists of both correct and erroneous
SIP messages, URLs and headers. The erroneous SIP messages are expected
to generate exceptions. The exceptions that they generate result in an
exception handler being called (see Torture.java). The test engine tests
to see whether exceptions were generated as expected and whether the right
information was presented to the handler on exception.  The format of
the input xml file is self explanatory (see  the comments in torture.xml).

torture.xml contains the SIPPING torture test cases. The parser passes all
the test cases.

Thanks to Bruno Konik for entering the sipping torture test cases.
