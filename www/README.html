<h2> Acknowledgements </h2>

<ul>
<li>
Marc Bednarek and Christophe Chazeau were guest researchers at NIST when
NIST-SIP 1.0 and NIST-SIP 1.1 were in development. Their contributions
are acknowledged.
<li>
The JAIN-SIP 1.1 API design is largely based on the NIST implementation
experiences of JAIN-SIP 1.0. The help of Chris Harris from DynamicSoft
(Spec Lead for JAIN-SIP 1.0) in understanding JAIN-SIP 1.0 is hereby
acknowledged. Implementing JAIN-SIP-1.0 was a great learning experience.
Hopefully our hindsight is good.
</ul>

<p> Design contributions to JAIN SIP 1.1 API were made by:

<ul>
<li> Brian O'Neill and Josh Burger (currently at BaseVoice).

<li> Dave Ferry and Ben Evans  from  Open Cloud inc. 

<li> Brad Templeton suggested that Dialog.sendBye be changed to the more 
generally useful Dialog.sendRequest. 

<li>
Emil Ivov, Brad Templeton and others requested a method to create a cancel
and Ack request for a client transaction and consequently 
ClientTransaction.createCancel  was added to the API.

</ul>
<hline/>
<p>
Bug Reports and enhancements for NIST-SIP 1.2 were contributed 
by the following people:

<ul>
<li> Brad Templeton noticed bugs in the Transaction/Dialog layer
   Brad suggested that Dialog.sendBye be changed to a more general
   Dialog.sendRequest Brad templeton noticed that the stack was
   sending out a Trying immediately and thereby not giving the application
   a chance to do so.

<li> Emil Ivov Contributed IPV6 Support. Emil Cotributed the Video Softphone
    under GPL Licensing. (See acknowledgement above). Emil noticed spec
    documentation bugs.  Emil uncovered bugs in the transaction layer
    implementation for several corner cases. Emil and Iain Macdonnell from 
    Sun reported a problem with SDP parsing. Emil discovered a bug in the
    Server transaction implementation. Emil contributed comprehensive 
    state machine unit tests of the Transaction layer to the TCK 
    (work in progress). 

<li> Andreas Byström reported bugs in set/get methods for Authentication 
    headers (quotes were missing). Andreas reported bugs in the 
    SDP implementation. Andreas helped to unit test call flows.  Andreas
    found documentation bugs and reported problems and incompleteness with
    the TCK.  Andreas noticed problems with Acking 487. Ack should be sent
    before the TU gets called. Andreas noted that CANCEL should not 
    contain content. Andreas noted that a dialog can change from client to
    server in the middle of the dialog (for example client sends a re-invite
    and puts caller on hold -- see sipping service examples draft). The
    RI was not allowing this. This was fixed and tested by Andreas.

<li> Antonis Karydas reported bugs in the implementation of the JAIN transaction
    model. Server transactions were being created with non-null TID
    on reciept of invites. Antonis reported that To/From headers should
    not be restricted only to use SIP urls. Antonis reported that 
    route sets were not properly maintained in the DialogImpl. Antonis
    reported that the DefaultRouterImplementation should be able to handle
    NON-SIP URLs. Antonis fixed a bug in Dialog.sendRequest() and 
    Dialog.createRequest(). Antonis reported several bugs in the strategy
    being used for dealing with ACKs for 4xx responses. Antonis reported
    a problem in handling Server transaction timeouts and posted a fix
    for this problem. Antonis reported a problem in content length for
    generation of responses. Antonis reported a problem with closely 
    spaced ACKs for CANCELed Server Transactions. Antonis reported that
    CANCEL after OK was not properly handled (stack should respond OK
    to cancel and not bother application.

<li> Beichuang reported bugs in the IM Client and presence server. BC also
    noted that extension methods were not working (Dialogs were not being 
    created).

<li> Steve Crossley reported bugs in the parser and setting local/remote party
     of dialog layer. Steve contributed a fix to the next hop determination
     in the Dialog code that could allow it to deal with legacy systems.
     Steve noticed that the short form of Refer-To was not supported in
     the parser. Steve noticed that null pointers were being generated
     when SessionDescriptionImpl was being cloned with null fields.
     Steve reported that content length was being set to 0 when the
     content of the SIP message is specified as an Object.

<li> Viswashanti Raj Kadiyala reported a bug and contributed a bug fix
     in the initialization of the tcp message channel. Shanti also
     reported a bug and contributed a bug fix for reciever tagging for
     Via headers.

<li> Andrew Prokop reported a bug in cloning of Authentication headers.

<li> Bob Johnson noticed documentation bugs.

<li> Mark Smith noticed that there were bugs in the handling of lr in the proxy.

<li> Tiago Dias (Altitude software) noticed that there was a bug with 
	subscribe/notify processing in the proxy. Tiago noticed that
	Notify processing in the proxy (presence extension) 
        was not returning final response immediately and contributed
	a bug fix for the proxy that rectified the problem.

<li> Roberto Tealdi reported a problem in instantiating multiple
	stacks in multi-homed hosts. 

<li> Laurent Schwitzer noticed that events were being dropped (not delivered
	to application) when request and response were closely spaced
	in time. Laurent noticed that the recieved parameter was not
	handling ipv6 address types.

<li> Stuart Woodsford (British Telecom) noticed a bug in the parsing of host 
	names when there are more than 3 components in the host name.

<li> Brian J. Collins discovered bugs in the implementation of SdpFactory.

<li> Dekeyzer Dmitri  noted that PRACK was not updating the Dialog 
      state and therefore route sets were not being applied appropriately.

<li> Willem Romijn AT&T corrected the payload type constant for H.263 codecs
	in SdpConstants.java

<li> Peter Parnes noted a bug in handling null messages. Null messages
could be sent to keep alive firewall NAT mappings. Peter tested
the stack on a dual multiprocessor hyperthreaded machine and
uncovered some race conditions in the transaction state machine
implementation that were later fixed.

<li> Christophe at yahoo.fr noticed a bug in the transaction state
machine when the retransmission filter is enabled. Christophe noted a
bug in IOHandler when an IO Exception occurs while transmitting via TCP.
Christophe noted a stack bug when IOException occurs (timer tick needs
to be updated). Christophe tested the stack for Exception conditions
under TCP Transport and uncovered some bugs in retransmission filter
implementation under these conditions.  Christophe noted that the stack
was trying to retry connections for sending responses. This is against
the SIP RFC (request/response should use the same connection) and it
was fixed.


<li> Gareth Deli noticed a bug in TCP transport. 

<li> Ben Evans (Open Cloud)
     noticed a transaction state machine implementation error
     in SIPServerTransaction. Ben Evans reported numerous TCK related problems.

<li> Zvalli at dev.java.net reported bugs in the parsing of warning headers and
     found a bug when there was a whitespace separating the header name
     and the : following it.


<li> Sverker Abrahamsson reformatted everything to conform to the java
    style guide and eliminated many annoying javadoc problems.


<li> Bruno Konik torture tested the parser and unearthed some
     problems with the parsing of SIP urls and methods. 
     These problems were fixed. Bruno contributed the torture test
     cases from the IETF torture test case draft-ietf-sipping-torture-tests.txt
     that are included in the torture test (tests/torture) directory.
     Bruno noted that the Rack header was encoded in the wrong way.
     Bruno noted that SIPDate header was encoded in the wrong way (should
     use 24 hour date format).

<li> Wanrong Lin noted that the spec called for a dummy dialog to be created
	even if there is no possibility of a transaction being assigned to
	a dialog. This was fixed - now a static dummy dialog is assigned to a
	transaction that has no possibility of being assigned to any dialog.

<li> Mafasumi Watanabe noted that setting message content as a string should
	compute content length after converting to byte rather than directly
	take length() to allow for double byte character set.

<li> Emmanuel Proulx noticed a bug when trying to send large amounts of 
	data via TCP transport that was caused by a race condition in
	the coded that caches threads and connections. 
	A new configuration parameter gov.nist.javax.sip.MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE 
	was added to limit the max size of messages.

<li>Venkatesh from CMU noticed that there were threads hanging around
even after all stack resources had been released. This was corrected
by adding a stack finalization method that exits all threads. The stack
now runs happily as an applet.


<li> Dave Stuart (SIPQuest Communications) discovered a deadlock with
the stack and submitted a bug fix for this. Dave also discovered an
error with ParametersHeader in converting String to boolean.


<li> Thomas Froment submitted a bug fix for parsing of
host:port as discovered in the CERT tests (there could be one or more
spaces between host and port). Thomas suggested that the main scanner
thread be eliminated from the SIPTransaction Stack and Timers be used
Thomas Fromet and Pierre De Rop  suggested a fast lookup path be
added for looking up Transactions. An auxilliary hash table for quick
lookup was added based on their suggestions. Thomas contributed
a bug fix for sending responses in server transactions. The maddr
parameter was being ignored.

<li>Alex Rootham from Blue Slice noticed that out of sequence messages
directed to a Dialog should be responded to with a 500 (Internal Server
Error) by a UAS.  This is decidedly strange but the spec does say so. This
support was added to the dialog layer of the stack.

<li>Bruce Evangelder from Soleo communications found a race condition
with the UDP message processor.


<li>Mike Andrews contributed the idea of a configurable network layer. This
can be used to better integrate with a container and provide management
and other functionality.

<li> Matt Keller noticed a bug where the ACK for 300-699 responses was being
sent to the wrong destination because the contact header in the last response
was being ignored. Mat sent in a bug fix for this problem.

<li> Bill Roome (AT&T research) noted that Applications may want to see
the route header. The stack was previously stripping it. 
A configuration parameter was added to pass the route header up to 
the application.

<li> Stefan Marx found a bug in the SipUriImpl.getHeaderNames function.

<li> John Martin from RockSteady noticed some uncessary synchronization
in the MessageHandler that was removed. 

<li> Daniel Martinez contributed TLS support. </li>

<li> Hagai Sela added support for symmetric NAT (rport parameter handling
 in via header). </li>

<li> Rob Daugherty (Lucent) detected a bug in handling of TCP messages
and contributed a fix for this. </li>

<li>Jeff Adams ( Polycomm.com ) submitted a patch for the sniffer tool.
Jef submitted a patch for setting the timer on the Transaction Timer. </li>

</ul>
