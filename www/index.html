<head><title>JAVA API for SIP Signaling </title></head>
<BODY>
<p>
Contains RI, TCK, examples, tools for JAIN-SIP-1.2 
(JSR-32 maintenance release)  and an SDP library that conforms to the 
public release of  JSR 141 (JAIN-SDP) interfaces.  
JAIN-SIP RI is a full implementation of RFC 3261.
JAIN-SDP interfaces are still under public review and are subject to change.
Tools include a signaling trace viewer that can take input from an etherreal/stack trace. RI, TCK and tools are in the public domain.

<h1> Get the Source </h1>

<a href=http://download.java.net/communications/jain-sip/nightly/><b>Get the nightly build snapshot.</b> </a>

<br/>
<br/>
<b> The best way to get the latest source is to use cvs. To access cvs you need to join the project as an observer. </b> <br/>

<ul>
<li>
Join the project on java.net as an observer. You need to join java.net 
first and apply to the project for an observer role. After that is approved
check out the project from java.net.
<li> To check out the project from java.net:
<ul>
<li> CVS address is cvs.dev.java.net
<li> Module name is jain-sip
<li> CVS login and passsword is your java.net login
</ul>
</ul>

<h1> News </h1>
<ul>
<li><b> The TCK for JSIP-1.2 is Complete! 
If you are implementing this specification,
you can test your implementation against the TCK </b>
<li><b> The CVS repository has been moved from NIST to java.net. </b></li>

<b> After much tweaking and optimizing the JAIN-SIP 1.2 RI performance
has improved considerably. It measures 70 CAPS on a single processor
2 Ghz Pentium 5 with 1 Gb of RAM. Image size reaches about 130 Megabytes.
The stack measured over 200 CAPS on a 4 processor Netra. No memory leaks
were noted over 1000000 calls.</b>
<li><b> The JAIN-SIP wiki is making progress.

<p> A usable subset of this project 
has been "ported" to j2me. Current work in progress includes 
adding interfaces to support JSR 180 (SIP For J2ME). 
However, the stack (without the JSR 180 interfaces)
is use-able as is. Join the  <br/>
<a href="http://sip-for-me.dev.java.net/"> sip-for-me </a>  project
on java.net as an observer to get the code from cvs on java.net.

<p>You can imbed the JAIN-SIP stack in an applet, HTTP servlet or an 
application  - check out <br/>
